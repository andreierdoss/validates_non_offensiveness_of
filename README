An ActiveRecord style validation method intended to prevent profanity and other
"offensive" content.

A list of offensive or disallowed words can be edited in lib/offensive_words.yml

Usage:

class Review < ActiveRecord::Base
  validates_non_offensiveness_of :body
end

@review = Review.new(:body => "Turd burglar")
@review.valid? #=> false
@review.errors #=> {:body => "can not contain the word 'Turd'"}
